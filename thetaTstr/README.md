This is a 2d workshop that illustrates how to randomise 2d polar coordinates  in the manner that will be applied to 3d spherical coordinates for the final visualization.

 [This link](http://mathinsight.org/polar_coordinates)  holds my my favorite explanation for using/calculating polar coordinates.
